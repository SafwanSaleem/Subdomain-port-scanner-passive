# Subdomain-Port-Scanner-Passive: Free Passive Subdomain Discovery & Top Port Scanner

A practical, free tool for discovering subdomains passively and scanning top ports across discovered hosts. It pulls from multiple subdomain sources and public datasets, including Shodan InternetDB, with no API keys required. The project is designed for bug bounty hunters, penetration testers, and security researchers who need quick reconnaissance data on macOS and Linux. This README details how the tool works, how to use it responsibly, and how to contribute to its ongoing improvement.

## üß≠ Overview

Subdomain-Port-Scanner-Passive is a lightweight, script-based solution that blends passive subdomain discovery with a focused port-scan pass. The goal is to yield fast, actionable insight without the friction of API keys or paid services. In practice, you get a compact dataset that helps you map a target's attack surface, prioritizes assets by exposure, and surfaces potential misconfigurations that warrant deeper follow-up.

Key strengths:
- Passive discovery from diverse, openly accessible sources
- Top port scanning to identify commonly exposed services
- No API keys required; works with public data
- Cross-platform compatibility: macOS and Linux
- Outputs in friendly, machine-readable formats (JSON, CSV)
- Extensible architecture to add more data sources and ports
- Safe for initial reconnaissance in legitimate security research

The repository topics reflect the breadth of this project: bash-script, bug-bounty, certificate-transparency, cybersecurity, free-tools, penetration-testing, port-scanner, reconnaissance, shodan, subdomain-enumeration.

## üß© How it works

This solution follows a two-stage approach: discovery and evaluation. It remains intentionally simple to keep the tool approachable, fast, and easy to audit.

- Discovery phase
  - Collects subdomain candidates from passive sources, such as certificate transparency logs, public DNS dumps, and public reconnaissance datasets.
  - Incorporates Shodan InternetDB data to broaden coverage of known hosts without requiring API keys.
  - Deduplicates and validates basic syntax of discovered names to reduce noisy data.
  - Creates a compact subdomain inventory that serves as the basis for the next phase.
- Port-evaluation phase
  - For each discovered subdomain, a top-port scan is performed to identify open services commonly found on the internet.
  - Scanning focuses on a curated list of ports that are frequently exposed and relevant to security assessments.
  - Results are tied back to the source subdomain, including provenance hints about data origin.
- Reporting and export
  - Outputs data in JSON and CSV formats suitable for scripting, reporting, or feeding into dashboards.
  - Includes fields like subdomain, resolved IP (if applicable), port, protocol, service hint, source, and timestamp.
  - Supports sorting and filtering by source, subdomain, or port for targeted analysis.

The design emphasizes reproducibility and transparency. You can inspect the code paths that gather data, merge results, and emit final records. If you need to replicate a prior run, the same data sources and port lists produce consistent outputs given the same environment.

## üß≠ Data model and output formats

JSON example (simplified)
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-13T12:34:56Z",
  "subdomain": "app.example.com",
  "ip": "93.184.216.34",
  "port": 443,
  "protocol": "tcp",
  "service_hint": "https",
  "source": "CT logs; Shodan InternetDB",
  "notes": "subdomain surfaced via CT; port 443 open"
}

CSV columns (ordered)
timestamp,subdomain,ip,port,protocol,service_hint,source,notes

Output considerations
- Deduplication: The tool filters duplicates to reduce noise.
- Sorting: Results can be sorted by subdomain, IP, or port to suit your report layout.
- Provenance: Each row includes the data source provenance to help you assess confidence.

Practical considerations
- Snapshot vs. live: Subdomain data from public sources can vary over time. Plan to re-run scans to monitor changes.
- Port exposure: Top-ports scanning highlights services likely exposed to the internet; deeper testing should follow with explicit authorization.
- Data retention: Use secure storage and handle any sensitive outputs with care.

---

## üîí Security, ethics, and responsible usage

- This tool is designed for authorized security research and lawful testing. Ensure you have permission to test targets and that your activities comply with applicable laws and organizational policies.
- Do not use the tool to disrupt services, exfiltrate data, or probe targets without explicit authorization.
- Maintain a responsible data handling approach. Treat discovered subdomains as potentially sensitive, especially if they reveal internal networks or misconfigurations.
- If you observe sensitive information while testing, follow standard reporting channels and do not publish details without consent.

Ethical considerations include clear scope definitions, data minimization, and prompt reporting of significant vulnerabilities to the proper owners.

## üß∞ Data sources and integration details

- Subdomain discovery
  - Certificate Transparency logs: Public CT data helps surface subdomains associated with TLS certificates.
  - DNS data dumps: Public zone files and other DNS artifacts provide candidate subdomains.
  - Public reconnaissance datasets: Aggregated lists from open sources that people publish for security research.
- Public exposure data
  - Shodan InternetDB: Used to augment found hosts with publicly known exposure cues and service hints.
- Data fusion
  - Deduplication and normalization: The pipeline merges duplicates and normalizes subdomain formats to ensure consistent reporting.
  - Provenance tagging: Each result carries a short provenance record that describes the source data lineage.

This combination gives you a practical view of an organization‚Äôs attack surface, focusing on passive discovery and observable services.

---

## üß≠ Performance and reliability

- Parallelism: The workflow uses parallel data collection and port checks to accelerate results without overloading any single source.
- Rate discipline: The tool incorporates sensible pacing to respect external sources and minimize noise embedded in public datasets.
- Retry logic: Transient network issues are retried to maintain data completeness without stalling the entire run.
- Fault tolerance: Individual subdomain entries failing to resolve or time out do not crash the whole process.

Real-world usage often yields a robust initial reconnaissance map within a short time window, enabling security teams to act quickly on the findings.

---

## üß≠ Troubleshooting and common scenarios

- Dependency issues: If the script complains about missing commands (grep, jq, curl), install core utilities for your platform. On macOS, you may need to install via Homebrew (brew install coreutils jq).
- Permission errors: Ensure the script has execute permission and that you‚Äôre allowed to write to the specified output directory.
- Data source unavailability: If a source is temporarily unreachable, the pipeline continues with the remaining sources. You‚Äôll see a log line indicating the skipped source and the reason.
- Invalid input: If you provide an invalid domain, the script should log the issue and skip to the next item rather than failing hard.
- Output format issues: If you need a different format, adjust the -t option and the corresponding fields in the output writer. The project supports JSON and CSV; you can extend it with a small adapter.

If you encounter a problem not covered here, consult the release notes for changes or open an issue in the repository to discuss improvements.
